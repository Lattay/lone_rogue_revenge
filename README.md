# Rogue Ship Return

## About

*Rogue Ship Return* is a space top down shooter heavily inspired by the arcade game Bosconian from Namco (1981).

It is mostly a clone, but I don't try to make it accurate at all.
I just think most choices in the original game where goods.

The game is written with Python and Pygame.
